# Drive Manager
Drive Manager is an under development web application that allows users to manage and control access permissions for files and folders stored on their Google Drive. It offers a user-friendly interface to easily manage access and detailed views of current permissions.

The application uses the Google Drive API to securely connect to users' Google Drive accounts and manage permissions accordingly.

It is built using the following technologies:

* Next.js for server-side rendering for better performance and to build fast and scalable React applications
* Ant Design for a sleek and modern design
* TypeScript for a type-safe and maintainable codebase
* Google Drive API for securely connecting to users' Google Drive accounts and managing permissions

The application is still under development but it will be a powerful tool to manage users' files and folders on Google Drive.
